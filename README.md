conference_scheduler
====================

Code to schedule conference


Steps to run the solution:

1) Run the ConferenceScheduler.java class. It has main method which loads the test data.<br/>
2) For testing the program run Tests.java which has 6 test cases for both maximizing the presenters and minimizing the cost.<br/>
3) You can provide data through your CSV file by calling CSVData.readCSV(File file);<br/>
